There are two useful branches here. One branch is the service under test (service_branch) and the other is the BDD tests (BDD_tests_branch).

They can be cloned using the following commands or by fiddeling with the GitHub web UI (note the branches in the drop-down selector):<p>
git clone -b BDD_tests_branch https://github.com/lancerkind/Soapy-BDD-To-Test-Services.git demo_service_tests <p>
git clone -b service_branch https://github.com/lancerkind/Soapy-BDD-To-Test-Services.git demo_service <p>
